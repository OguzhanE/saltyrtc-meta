# SaltyRTC

SaltyRTC is an **end-to-end encrypted signalling protocol**. It offers 
to freely choose from a range of signalling tasks, such as setting up a 
**WebRTC** or **ORTC** peer-to-peer connection. SaltyRTC is completely open to new and custom signalling tasks for everything feasible.

In this repository, you can find...

* The [SaltyRTC Signalling Protocol](Protocol.md).
* The [SaltyRTC WebRTC Task Protocol](Task-WebRTC.md) to set up a 
  secure WebRTC peer-to-peer connection by using SaltyRTC's end-to-end 
  encryption techniques.
* The [SaltyRTC Chunking Specification](Chunking.md) used by SaltyRTC's 
  WebRTC task. However, the specification can also be used as a generic 
  message chunking solution.
